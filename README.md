# WorkingStiff AI  
**Applied AI & Systems Learning Project**

## Overview
WorkingStiff AI is a self-directed, hands-on learning project focused on understanding how modern, AI-assisted systems are structured, deployed, and supported. The goal of this project is practical exposure to real-world tools and workflows rather than building a production-grade AI product.

This repository serves as a learning environment to explore backend services, APIs, containerized systems, and applied AI tools from a **support and operations perspective**.

## Project Focus
My primary focus areas include:
- Running and troubleshooting services in a Linux environment
- Working with containerized applications using Docker
- Interacting with and testing REST APIs
- Understanding how AI tools integrate into real workflows
- Following documentation, diagnosing issues, and iterating safely
- Practicing version control and documentation review using Git/GitHub

## Technologies & Tools (Exposure Level)
- Linux (Ubuntu, RHEL fundamentals)
- Docker (running containers, logs, service inspection)
- Python (FastAPI – exposure and support-level usage)
- Node.js (fundamental understanding)
- REST APIs (testing and troubleshooting)
- Git / GitHub
- AI tools & large language models (applied usage, not model training)
- Cloud concepts (storage, serverless fundamentals)

## Scope & Leveling
This project reflects **applied learning and support-level experience**.  
It is not intended to represent senior engineering, system architecture ownership, or production responsibility.

The emphasis is on:
- Understanding how systems fit together
- Troubleshooting and problem isolation
- Learning modern tools in realistic scenarios

## Why This Project Exists
Rather than learning technologies in isolation, this project provides exposure to how multiple components interact in a real system. It supports a transition into Help Desk, IT Support, and Applied AI Technician roles where understanding systems, documentation, and workflows is critical.
